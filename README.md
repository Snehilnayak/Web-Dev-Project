# Web-Dev-Project
In this project i have made a fully working web application which can be used to manage the customers and their orders in an efficient way. Here a new customer has to register in the registration page and now a page has been allocated to the customer where he can see all his orders and can also update his personal information including his profile pic. Admin of the page is the one who controls the whole application and has a separate password and userid and also a different page if he enters using login page . Admin can update , delete and create orders for any customer.
