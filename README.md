# Web-Dev-Project

In this project i have made a fully functional web dev application which helps us in managing multiple customers and their orders at the same time. Firstly a customer has to login so that that his data enters in the site and a new page is dedicated for that particular customer where he can view all his orders and also set some of his personal informations including his profile pic. Now all the orders of customer are added by the admin of the application through the admin page, which is nothing but the a page dedicated particularly for admins. In the login page the admin has to enter his password and username and now he can make changes to the whole application , he can creater new orders , delete some of the orders , update orders etc.. Please refer to screenshots folder to get an idea about the application
